#  DemoApp - Technical Assessment

This project is a technical assessment for a Frontend Developer role at Avaier Pvt Ltd, implementing a responsive loan application dashboard based on the provided requirements.

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** – React Framework for server-rendered and client-side pages
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS for consistent, responsive styling
- **ShadCN UI** – Accessible, customizable UI components built on Radix primitives
- **Lucide Icons** – Clean, consistent icon set
- **Zustand** – Lightweight state management for active borrower and shared context
- **TypeScript** – Type safety across the project
- **Playwright** – Basic end-to-end testing setup

##  Why NextJS over ReactJS?

In this project, I chose Next.js over plain React.js to take advantage of built-in server-side rendering, automatic routing, and powerful performance optimizations, all of which are essential for building fast, scalable, production-ready applications.

##  Features & Highlights

- Fully **responsive layout**
- **3-Column Grid** for desktop, collapses to stacked layout for mobile
- Modular, reusable React components for maintainability
- Borrower Pipeline with **tab filters** and dynamic active profile selection
- Borrower Detail pane with status badges, AI Explainability section, Loan Summary, and escalation actions
- Broker Overview with key stats, contact actions, onboarding workflow, and AI Assistant toggle
- Accessible, consistent design using Tailwind and ShadCN
- Uses **Zustand** for global state and data fetching
- Basic E2E test with Playwright to validate core interactions

##  Component Breakdown

- `Layout` – Page structure with responsive grid  
- `BorrowerPipeline` – Left panel with tabs, borrower list, and radio section

##  API Mock

- Mock API responses based on provided structure (`api/` folder)  
- No backend integration; uses local JSON data for demo

##  Testing

- Playwright setup for basic end-to-end tests:  
  - Borrower selection updates detail pane  
  - Explainability accordion expands/collapses  
  - Button actions trigger console logs (mocked behavior)
